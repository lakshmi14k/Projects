**REMOTE COUNSELLING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

**INTRODUCTION**

This repository contains details of the final project completed as part of the course DAMG 6210 - Data Managent and Database Design at Northeastern University, under the guidance of Professor Manuel Montrond.

**OVERVIEW**

In the current rapid-paced society, mental well-being is something that is not valued as much as it should be. The hustle and bustle of modern life has contributed to a significant rise in mental health issues, which has in turn established the need for better mental health care and counselling systems. Mental trauma is a common issue faced by people, irrespective of their age, background, or position in society. Lately, the importance of mental well-being has been significantly recognized. Unaddressed mental trauma leads to severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Many people consider not going to therapy because they canâ€™t face discussing their issues in person. In that case, a remote counselling system would be of huge help.
